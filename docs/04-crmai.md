## 🚀 Feature: Deep Profile Enrichment

When a name or LinkedIn URL is input, the **Research Agent** triggers:

1.  **Search Grounding**: Queries latest brand affiliations and press mentions.
2.  **Sentiment Synthesis**: Analyzes past event attendance vs. social mentions.
3.  **Dossier Generation**: Creates a "Strategic Approach" for the Director (e.g., "Julianne prefers private viewings over large gala events").

## 🧠 Influence Graphing (The Network Effect)

The system visualizes "Power Clusters" where influential nodes intersect:

```mermaid

    User[Director] -->|Strong Connection| EditorA[Vogue France]
    EditorA -->|Power Cluster| StylistB[Paris Circle]
    StylistB -->|Influence| TalentC[Global Ambassador]
    
    User -->|Pathfinder| TalentC
    Note[AI Suggests: Ask Editor A for Introduction]
```

## 🛠️ Automated Workflows

- **Outreach Orchestrator**: Uses **Context Retrieval** to draft personalized show invites based on the last 3 interactions.
- **Sentiment Guard**: Flags "Cooling Relationships" if a key stakeholder hasn't been engaged in 60 days.
